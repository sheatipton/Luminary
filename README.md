## Installation
To run Luminary locally on your machine, please follow these steps:

1. Install XAMPP: Download and install XAMPP, which provides a local web server environment with Apache, PHP, and MySQL. You can download XAMPP from the [official website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and follow the installation instructions.

2. Start Apache and MySQL: Launch XAMPP and start the Apache web server and MySQL database server. This will allow your local environment to serve the PHP pages and interact with the database.

3. Import the Database: Open a web browser and visit http://localhost/phpmyadmin. This will take you to the phpMyAdmin interface. Create a new database named "Luminary" and import the provided SQL file (luminary.sql) included with the project.

4. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/luminary.git`

5. Move Files: Move the cloned dreambook folder into the htdocs directory of your XAMPP installation. The exact path will depend on your operating system, but it is typically located at C:\xampp\htdocs on Windows or /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs on macOS.

6. Configuration: Open the luminary/setup/db.connect.php file and update the database credentials (host, username, password) to match your local setup.

7. Access Luminary: Open a web browser and visit http://localhost/luminary to access the website.
